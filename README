This java project is designed to generate giberish words - that is words that do not exist in the english language.
However, the caviate is that these words are supposed to be pronouncable. This works by feeding the program a large set of real words from the English Language. It uses this to develop patterns in common characters and to pronounce artificial words that are similar. 

Some concepts used in this project:
-Tree structure
-extensive use of objects
-processing large amounts of data efficiently

This was one of my favorite projects I've developed! Please feel free to look into it in depth and to understand how it works.
